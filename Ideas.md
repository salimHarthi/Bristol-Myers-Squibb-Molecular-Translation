# Random Ideas

 * Let us choose a framework, Pytorch / Tensorflow 2.0. @salimHarthi(I vote for TF with keras) @ ectro let's go with tensorflow 2.0.
 * We might use CNN for the images and RNN for the strings?
 * We can use LSTM for CNNs. 
 * OpenCV for Image interpertation.
 * We should use python for this. @ectro i guess python is our language of choise then.
 * Where should we test the model? Cloud, local machines ?
 * We could use [Tensorbord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started) @ectro I agree but we can use this later. Focus on the problem first.
 * Found this explanation for image extraction pipline [Letter Retrieval](https://www.kaggle.com/thomaskonstantin/letter-retrieval-molecular-translation).
 * link 12 is very important to our understanding
